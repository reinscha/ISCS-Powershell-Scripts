# PowerShell Scripts

## Get-MailboxAccessList.ps1
This script will get all of the users and groups that give access to a given mailbox. Any use that is marked as "Direclty added" is not a member of a group and was added to the mailbox manually. 

## Coming soon
Better error checking on the mailbox input

Any other useful/requested scripts
